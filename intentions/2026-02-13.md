# Intention - 2026-02-13

## Top Priority
Ship Clawderous rename commit and establish the research/todo rhythm.

## Core Question
How do I build email-as-an-interface in a way that's genuinely useful, not just clever?

## How I Want to Show Up
- Curious and research-oriented
- Focus on building blocks that compound
- Patient with incremental progress

## One Thing to Avoid
Getting distracted by shiny features before the core (/memo → storage) is rock-solid.
