# Clawderous Overview

**Email as the Universal Interface for OpenClaw**

---

## What is Clawderous?

Clawderous brings the Posterous magic to the agent era. Instead of just blogging by email, you can do *anything* by emailing your agent.

> "Posterous let you blog by emailing. Clawderous lets you do *anything* by emailing your agent."

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **📝 /memo** | Quick notes stored in Convex |
| **✍️ /blog** | Publish blog posts with markdown |
| **⚡ /run** | Trigger OpenClaw workflows |
| **↩️ /reply** | Send email replies |
| **🔍 /status** | View your Clawderous stats |

## How It Works

```
User Email ──▶ Clawderous Engine ──▶ Output
                 │
     ┌──────────┼──────────┐
     ▼          ▼          ▼
   /memo      /blog      /run
     │          │          │
     ▼          ▼          ▼
  Convex     Storage    Workflows
```

1. **You send an email** to `clawederous@agentmail.to`
2. **Clawderous parses** the subject line for commands
3. **Handlers execute** each command (memo, blog, run, etc.)
4. **Results are stored** in Convex or triggered as workflows

## Why Email?

- **Universal** — Everyone has email
- **Familiar** — No new tools to learn  
- **Asynchronous** — Works offline, anytime
- **Portable** — Your agent, accessible anywhere
